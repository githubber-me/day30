# September Coding Chapter by Anthahkarana

This repository is a part of the thirty days coding campaign conducted for the core team of GDSC, BIT in September 2023. I started learning front-end development in this month and here are the thirty programs that I've programmed and studied as a part of this campaign.



## Deployment

I have deployed these programs at https://githubber-me.github.io/1h0st/ so as to provide a better interface. 
## Certification

I completed an 'Introduction to JavaScript' certification course by Sololearn inc. during this same period. It can be found here :- https://www.sololearn.com/certificates/CC-VMO9RFL0
